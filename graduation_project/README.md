Study Space is our graduation project mobile app that helps students all to !nd a place to study and share knowledge.

Study Space developed using flutter framework. It seeks to offer a better and
 more optimal solution for E-learning.

 My job was dealing with the back-end developer by using the Restful APIs through JSON libraries, create an amazing UX/UI and implement social login buttons like Facebook, Google, and Twitter.
